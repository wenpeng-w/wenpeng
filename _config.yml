# Welcome to Jekyll!

#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find

# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files

# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.


# Site settings

# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.

# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
